# U2 Stablecoin (BTC-Collateralized Settlement Layer)

## Overview
**U2** is the native stablecoin of B² Network, designed as a **BTC-collateralized, AI-native settlement asset**.
It bridges the gap between Bitcoin’s role as a volatile reserve currency and the need for **stable, predictable pricing** in AI-driven and DeFi economies.
U2 enables **AI Agents, miners, and users** to transact, collaborate, and settle with a consistent unit of account while maintaining Bitcoin exposure.

## Design Principles
- **BTC as Collateral**: Every U2 is minted against over-collateralized Bitcoin, ensuring trustless solvency.
- **Stability via Hedging**: Delta-neutral strategies (futures, perpetual swaps, basis trades) offset BTC volatility while preserving yield.
- **AI-Native**: Built for high-frequency, machine-to-machine (M2M) micropayments required by autonomous agents.
- **Transparent & Verifiable**: Collateral reserves and hedging operations are fully auditable on-chain, with anchoring into Bitcoin mainnet.

## Minting & Redemption
1. **Minting**
   - Users or AI Agents deposit BTC into the protocol vault.
   - U2 is minted at a collateral ratio ≥150% to ensure system safety.

2. **Redemption**
   - U2 can be burned to redeem locked BTC at any time.
   - Automated liquidation mechanisms protect solvency during BTC price drawdowns.

3. **Dual Pathways**
   - **Classic Mint**: Conservative, fully backed by BTC reserves, 1:1 collateral.
   - **Innovative Mint**: BTC + derivative hedges expand U2 supply while maintaining peg stability.

## Stability Mechanisms
- **Over-Collateralization**: Ensures solvency and resilience during market stress.
- **Delta-Neutral Hedging**: Offsets BTC volatility with market-neutral derivative strategies.
- **Funding Rate Arbitrage**: Captures yield from perpetual swap markets, distributing income to U2 stakers and the ecosystem.
- **Automated Liquidations**: Protect against under-collateralization, maintaining peg and system integrity.

## Technical Features
- **BTC-Denominated Collateral**: Reinforces Bitcoin’s role as the ultimate reserve asset.
- **Cross-Layer Anchoring**: Collateral proofs and hedging records anchored periodically to Bitcoin via Taproot inscriptions.
- **Integration with AI Signal**: AI Agents can hold and transact in U2 as their stable settlement asset, while still holding BTC as reserve capital.
- **Developer APIs**: Enables dApp builders to integrate U2 into DeFi protocols, agent marketplaces, and cross-chain applications.

## Use Cases
- **AI Agents**:
  - Settle micro-tasks, data exchange, or inference services with predictable pricing.
  - Engage in multi-agent collaboration without BTC volatility risk.

- **BTC Holders**:
  - Unlock liquidity by minting U2 against BTC while retaining BTC price exposure.
  - Earn BTC-native yield from hedging and arbitrage strategies.

- **Miners**:
  - Collateralize future hashrate or block rewards to mint U2.
  - Access immediate liquidity without selling mined BTC.

- **DeFi & Traders**:
  - Use U2 as a stable unit of account in lending, AMMs, and derivatives.
  - Perform arbitrage or structured strategies with BTC as reserve and U2 as settlement currency.

## Role in B² Network
U2 is the **settlement backbone** of the Bitcoin + AI economy:
- Provides **price stability** for agents and users.
- Links **BTC’s reserve value** with **AI’s transactional demands**.
- Enables the closed economic loop:
  **BTC → Collateral → U2 → AI Agents → Settlement → back to BTC.**

---

**In summary**:
U2 transforms Bitcoin from a passive “digital gold” into an **active settlement medium** — making the vision of
**“Put Bitcoin in Every AI’s Wallet”** a practical reality.
