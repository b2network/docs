# B² Network

## Vision
**Put Bitcoin in Every AI’s Wallet**
B² Network is building the settlement backbone for the AI era — where Bitcoin is no longer just “digital gold,” but the **currency of autonomous agents**.

We believe that:
- **Bitcoin** is the most secure, scarce, and censorship-resistant digital asset.
- **AI Agents** are becoming new economic actors, requiring native wallets and settlement tools.
- **Stablecoins** provide the predictable pricing and liquidity layer that makes large-scale adoption possible.

By uniting these three forces, B² Network transforms Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an **active medium of exchange for the AI economy**.

## Core Architecture
B² Network is built around **five tightly integrated modules**, each addressing a critical piece of the Bitcoin + AI puzzle:

1. **Mining² (DeFAI-Mining Router)**
   Routes miner hashrate and BTC rewards into validator pools and agent accounts, linking Proof-of-Work economics with Proof-of-Signal governance.

2. **B² Hub (Layer 1.5 PoSg Consensus)**
   A sovereign chain running Proof-of-Signal + Stake consensus, with application sharding and anchoring into Bitcoin for global security.

3. **B² Rollup (BTC-Anchored Execution Layer)**
   An EVM-compatible rollup that settles in BTC, posts proofs to Bitcoin, and enables dApps with BTC-native gas and trustless security.

4. **DSN-AI (Signal-Driven Agentic AI Layer)**
   A protocol where AI agents emit verifiable signals (Sense → Plan → Decide → Act → Learn) that shape consensus and economic flows.

5. **U2 Stablecoin (BTC-Collateralized Settlement Layer)**
   A Bitcoin-backed stablecoin designed for micro-payments and predictable pricing, serving as the unit of account for agents and DeFi.

## The Closed Loop
The modules form a **closed economic and technical loop**:
BTC → Mining² → B² Hub (PoSg) → B² Rollup → DSN-AI Signals → U2 Stablecoin → AI Agents → back to BTC.

This loop ensures:
- Bitcoin provides **security and reserve value**.
- AI Agents provide **signals and demand**.
- U2 provides **stability and usability**.
- The Hub + Rollup provide **execution and finality**.

## Why It Matters
- **For BTC holders**: Unlock liquidity via U2 without losing BTC exposure.
- **For AI agents**: Transact natively in BTC and U2 for micro-settlements.
- **For miners**: Monetize hashrate and future block rewards through stablecoin issuance.
- **For developers**: Deploy AI-native dApps and DeFi protocols with Bitcoin settlement.

**B² Network redefines Bitcoin’s role — from a passive store of value into the active settlement layer of the AI-driven economy.**
