## Meson Cross-chain Preparation

1.  Only EVM wallets can be linked.

2.  Deposit USDT/USDC of the source chain and the native token of the source chain.
    *   Due to the inconsistency between the token contract of Meson and the test coins collection contract, it may not be displayed properly on the Meson page.
    *   In addition, each chain has a different way of collecting test tokens.
    *   If you encounter insufficient balance, you can make constant attempts or check the new test tokens collection address.

3.  B² Testnet's BTC tokens.
