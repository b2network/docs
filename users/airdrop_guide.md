**– Claiming Rewards:**  
13、As of April 23, 2025, users can stake and unstake both Mining Rigs and Blockheadz. The first mining phase will officially begin with the TGE. Once it starts, users will begin to earn rewards. However, rewards from Phase 1 can only be claimed after the phase ends (i.e., four weeks after TGE).

The **“My Rewards”** section will display your staking rewards. Mining with Mining Rigs is divided into four phases, starting from the TGE:

* **Phase 1:** From TGE to 4 weeks after TGE

* **Phase 2:** Week 4 to Week 8 after TGE

* **Phase 3:** Week 8 to Week 12 after TGE

* **Phase 4:** Week 12 to Week 16 after TGE

Each phase’s rewards will become claimable **30 days (T+30)** after that phase ends, with a **30-day claim window**.  
Please make sure to claim your rewards within the specified period — **late claims will not be reissued.**
