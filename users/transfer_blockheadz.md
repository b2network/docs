Please be aware that in the process of bridging from the Bitcoin Mainnet to the B² Mainnet, we currently only support Native Segwit (P2WPKH) and Taproot (P2TR) address types. Nested Segwit (P2SH P2WPKH) and Legacy (P2PKH) address types are not supported at this time. It's important to note that we anticipate supporting all address types in the next version.

Moreover, if you use an unsupported address type for bridging, you will receive the following notification.
