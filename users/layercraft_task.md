**Step 5:**

Click the 【**LayerCraft**】 to return to the main page. Here, your NFT rewards will be visible. We can clearly see that the user has completed one divination session, and the NFT highlight indicates that the rewarded NFT has been obtained.
Each user has only 3 chances to divine. After completing 1 divination session, you can receive 30 points and 1 NFT. Similarly, after completing 3 divination sessions, you can receive 90 points and 3 NFT rewards on the B² Odyssey Task Platform.
