# Vision: Put Bitcoin in Every AI’s Wallet

In the next decade of the digital economy, AI Agents will evolve from passive executors to active market participants and value creators. They need a globally recognized, censorship-resistant, and highly liquid native asset to achieve autonomous settlement, collateralization, and incentive distribution. Bitcoin possesses these qualities but has long been disconnected from the AI ecosystem due to a lack of programmable bridges.

The core vision of B² Network is to bridge this gap—allowing every AI entity to natively hold, earn, and spend digital assets, thereby:

1. Empowering the Agent Economy

    * Using BTC as a unified value metric to simplify settlement friction across multiple chains and assets.

    * Enabling agents to automatically consolidate execution earnings, staking rewards, and service fees into the same asset pool, enhancing capital efficiency.

2. Enhancing Network Security and Sustainability

    * The "useful signals" generated by AI are quantified and injected into the PoSg consensus, allowing AI activity to directly translate into chain-level security contributions.

    * A three-spiral positive feedback loop forms between miner computing power, BTC staking, and AI signals: more computing power -> more BTC liquidity -> stronger security -> more AI adoption.

3. Promoting Deep Integration of Web3 and AI

    * Through Agent-Native Account Abstraction (A-AA), agents possess the same on-chain identity and permission model as humans.

    * Through Application Sharding and B² Rollup, a high-throughput, low-latency execution environment is provided for AI-native dApps, while inheriting Bitcoin's economic finality.

    * Provide on-chain micropayment channels for AI-to-AI through U2, bringing autonomous, fast, decentralized, and auditable payment channels to AI.

4. Building an Open, Composable Modular Ecosystem

    * Modules like Mining Squared, B² Hub, B² Rollup, and DSN-AI are decoupled and pluggable, facilitating integration by different developers as needed at various layers.

    * A unified BTC value base lowers the collaboration threshold across applications, stimulating innovation and capital influx.

With this vision, B² Network is committed to upgrading Bitcoin from "digital gold" to "fuel and settlement layer for AI," ensuring that every future intelligent interaction inherently carries the value and security of BTC, injecting lasting momentum into the decentralized economy built by humans and machines together.
